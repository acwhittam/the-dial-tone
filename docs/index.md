## about
With the deluge of new content produced each day on the internet, I found that my “to read” folder was growing at an unsustainable rate. Along with each new stream of content that I found, each new article also brought its own web of referenced material, follow-up reading or new subscription opportunities, only adding to my backlog. To combat this, I set out to filter and read articles found in the past 24 hours. A pleasant side effect of this was a curated, condensed list of interesting articles from the internet. From there, the “thedialtone” was born. 

I hope you enjoy it.

Andy
